# Bloom Filter

This repository contains a Python implementation of [Bloom Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter), a space-efficient probabilistic data structure.
> BloomFilter in SearchEngine (Solr) | by Lucky Sharma | MediumA Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test if an element is a member of a set, allowing for very fast membership queries with a high degree of accuracy but with the possibility of false positives (stating an element is present when it's not)

## Features

- Pure Python implementation.  
- Supports **k independent hash functions** using Pythonâ€™s `hashlib`.
- Modular: `BloomFilter` class can be imported and reused.

## Usage

Example usage are provided in the main.py file.
